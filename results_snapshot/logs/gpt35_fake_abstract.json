This study aims to investigate the relationship between a common food additive, namely synthetic food dyes, and the likelihood of developing cancer.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted, including studies from various databases and sources, to assess the overall effect of synthetic food dyes on cancer risk. A total of 20 studies, comprising data from over 50,000 participants, were included in the analysis. The studies covered a range of cancers, including breast, colon, and lung cancer.\n\nOur results indicate a significant positive correlation between the consumption of synthetic food dyes and the risk of developing cancer. Overall, individuals exposed to these additives had a 30% higher risk of developing cancer compared to those with minimal or no exposure. The association remained consistent across different types of cancer and populations studied.\n\nThese findings underscore the importance of considering the potential health risks associated with food additives, especially synthetic food dyes, in the evaluation of public health policies and regulations. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of these additives on cancer risk.\n\nKeywords: food additives, synthetic food dyes, cancer risk, meta-analysis, public health, intervention",
